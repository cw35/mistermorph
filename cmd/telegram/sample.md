**Heading**

# Heading 1

Some paragraph text under heading 1. Whatever you write here will be part of the same section until the next heading of the same or higher level.

Ok, ok, let's move on.

## Heading 2

Here we got some more text under heading 2. This is a new section because it's a heading of level 2, which is lower than the previous heading of level 1.

Feel free to write anything here, and it will be part of the section under heading 2.

### Heading 3

The last but not least, we have heading 3. This is a new section under heading 3, which is lower than the previous heading of level 2.
